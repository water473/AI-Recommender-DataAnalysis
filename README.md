# AI-Recommender-DataAnalysis
Dataset analysis and NLP model created with my team during my summer internship at Citi

# Dataset / Data analysis
Our dataset was made up of over 3 million complaints filed to Citi and other banks.

Using the Pandas python library, we get a sense of the dataset:

We also look at aspects such as which banks or products were complained about the most:

# NLP Model and Visualization

- Creating the model involved a few steps, such as text pre-processing and word embeddings. Here are some samples:

- We also completed topic modeling and clustering, and visualized the results. Here is one of the visualizations (Response topics):
